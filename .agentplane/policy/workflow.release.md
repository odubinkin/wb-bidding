# Workflow: release

Use this module when task touches release/version/publish flows.


## Required sequence

1. CHECKPOINT A: confirm clean tracked tree and approved scope.
2. CHECKPOINT B: review/fix active `.agentplane/policy/incidents.md` entries through a dedicated task, archive final evidence, and clean the active incident registry.
3. CHECKPOINT C: generate release plan and freeze version/tag target.
4. Generate release notes with complete human-readable coverage of all task-level changes.
5. Run release prepublish checks.
6. CHECKPOINT D: choose the workflow-specific publication route after all gates pass.
7. Record release evidence (commands, outputs, resulting version/tag).


## Command contract

```bash
git status --short --untracked-files=no
agentplane task plan set <task-id> --text "Release plan: version=<v>, tag=<t>, scope=<...>" --updated-by <ROLE>
agentplane task plan approve <task-id> --by ORCHESTRATOR
agentplane release plan --patch
agentplane release apply --push --yes   # direct mode only
agentplane release candidate --push --yes   # branch_pr mode only
agentplane verify <task-id> --ok|--rework --by <ROLE> --note "Release checks: ..."
agentplane finish <task-id> --author <ROLE> --body "Verified: release" --result "Release <v> published" --commit <git-rev> --close-commit
```


## Constraints

- MUST NOT perform irreversible release actions before explicit approval.
- MUST NOT start release planning, prepublish, or publish while `.agentplane/policy/incidents.md` contains active incident entries.
- MUST NOT skip parity/version checks.
- MUST NOT bypass required notes validation.
- MUST stop and request re-approval if release scope/tag/version changes.
- In `direct`, `release apply --push --yes` is the publication route and may create/push the release tag.
- In `branch_pr`, `release apply` is not the publication route; use `release candidate --push --yes`, merge the candidate into the protected base branch, then explicitly dispatch `Publish to npm` with the release commit `sha`.
